        "    gcloud pubsub topics create live-flight-data-stream\n",

        "2.  **Save the Code:** Save the Python code above into a file named `main.py`.\n",

        "4.  **Deploy the Cloud Function:** Use the `gcloud functions deploy` command. You'll need to specify:\n",

        "    *   `--trigger-http` (as it's an HTTP-triggered function, which can then be invoked by Cloud Scheduler)\n",

        "1.  **Ensure Pub/Sub Topic Exists:** Make sure your `live-data-stream` Pub/Sub topic exists.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3.  **Save the Code:** Save the Python code above into a file named `main.py`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Define Dependencies:** Create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory with the following content:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    functions-framework\n",
        "    google-cloud-bigquery\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Deploy the Cloud Function:** Use the `gcloud functions deploy` command. You'll need to specify:\n",
        "    *   `--runtime python312` (or your preferred Python version)\n",
        "    *   `--trigger-topic live-data-stream` (this tells the function to subscribe to your Pub/Sub topic)\n",
        "    *   `--entry-point subscribe_and_stream_to_bigquery` (the name of the function to execute)\n",
        "    *   `--region` (e.g., `us-central1`)\n",
        "    *   **Crucially, you need to ensure the Cloud Function's service account has permissions to write to BigQuery.** This typically means the `BigQuery Data Editor` role or a custom role with `bigquery.tables.insertAll` on the target table.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example deployment command:\n",
        "    ```bash\n",
        "    gcloud functions deploy pubsub-to-bigquery-streamer \\\n",
        "      --runtime python312 \\\n",

        "      --region us-central1\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "Once deployed, this function will automatically activate and ingest data into your BigQuery table whenever messages are sent to the `live-data-stream` Pub/Sub topic by your first Cloud Function (`publish_flight_data`)."
